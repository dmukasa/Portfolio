# Daniel Mukasa / PhD Researcher

## About me
```markdown
I'm a third year PhD Candidate working at the intersection of computational materials 
science, applied physics, and medical engineering at the California Institute of 
Technology (Caltech). My primary research focus is on the use of large data sets and 
advanced computational methods to accelerate chemical and materials discovery with 
applications ranging from biotechnology to applied physics problems.
