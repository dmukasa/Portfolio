## About me

I'm a third year PhD Candidate working at the intersection of computational material science, 
applied physics, and medical engineering at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). 
My primary research focus is on the use of large data sets and advanced computational methods 
to accelerate chemical and materials discovery.
